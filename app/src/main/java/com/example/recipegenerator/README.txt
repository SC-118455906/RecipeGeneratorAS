I, Sean Cronin, declare that, except where duly acknowledged, this project is entirely my own work

CODE GENERATION TOOLS
Android Studio will automatically generated base XML code for any items dragged and dropped onto a layout page for

I was able to download the foods.csv file from the foodb folder from this github repository:
https://github.com/yufree/expodb
This contained a list of ingredients, and food types
Component name: foods.csv

MODIFIED THIRD PARTY FILES
I modified the foods.csv file to remove some unnecessary columns and rename the food types to what I wanted.
I then imported this into my database in the form of my ingredients table and food type table.
